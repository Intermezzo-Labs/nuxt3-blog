# Ethereum Scaling: The Future of ETH Transactions

## Introduction
Ethereum is one of the most popular and widely-used cryptocurrencies in the world. However, as its usage has grown, so have the number of transactions on the network. This has led to some scaling issues, as the current infrastructure is not able to handle the large volume of transactions. In this post, we'll take a look at the current state of Ethereum scaling and the potential solutions that are being developed to improve the network's ability to handle more transactions.

## The Current State of Ethereum Scaling
Currently, Ethereum can only handle around 15 transactions per second (TPS). This is a very small number compared to other payment networks like Visa, which can handle thousands of TPS. This has led to high transaction fees and slow confirmation times for users.

## Potential Solutions
There are several solutions being developed to improve Ethereum's scalability. One of the most promising is the development of layer 2 scaling solutions, such as the Plasma and sharding. These solutions allow for off-chain transactions, which are then recorded on the main Ethereum blockchain. This can greatly increase the number of transactions that can be processed by the network.

Another solution being developed is called Eth 2.0, which is a complete overhaul of the Ethereum network. Eth 2.0 will introduce a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake, which is expected to greatly increase the network's TPS.

## Conclusion
The scalability of the Ethereum network is a critical issue that needs to be addressed in order for the cryptocurrency to reach its full potential. The solutions currently being developed, such as layer 2 scaling and Eth 2.0, have the potential to greatly improve the network's ability to handle more transactions. However, it's important to remember that these solutions are still in the early stages of development and it will take time to see how well they perform in the real world.
